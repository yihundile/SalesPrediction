# SalesPrediction
This code presents a sales prediction machine learning model. The model uses data from Kaggle, which is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data. The code includes:
- explanatory data analysis
- completing missing values and handling outliers, and 
- developing machine learning models

Four machine learning algorithms, namely linear regression, random forest, decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting, were evaluated. The random forest model provided the best prediction in which feature importance was run to identify the most important features. The code has sufficient markdown note to explain every step of the code. However, feel free to reach to me if you have any questions.

Thank you!
